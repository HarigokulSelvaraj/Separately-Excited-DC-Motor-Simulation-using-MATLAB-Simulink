Separately Excited DC Motor Simulation using MATLAB Simulink

●	Designed and simulated a Separately Excited DC Motor model in MATLAB Simulink using basic blocks such as Sum, Gain, Constant, and Integrator.

●	Modeled the motor’s electromechanical behavior using its Equivalent Circuit, applying Kirchhoff’s Voltage and Current Laws and Newton’s Second Law for Rotational Motion.

●	Implemented control-oriented mathematical equations to simulate armature dynamics, back EMF, and mechanical load torque, enabling a realistic and scalable simulation.

●	Verified dynamic response characteristics like motor speed, armature current, and electromagnetic torque under varying input conditions.

●	Gained practical experience in control system design, electromechanical system modeling, and MATLAB/Simulink-based simulation, relevant to electric motor control and automotive embedded applications.
